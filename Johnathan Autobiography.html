					<ul>
					    <li><b><i>Name, Age ,Personality, Area of Residence</b></i> </li>
					</ul>
					     <p><b>My name is Johnathan Peter Wickham and I am seventeen years old, born on October 10th 2006,so my horoscope is libra.I like to describe myself as an ambivert since 
						 I can be both inroverted and extroverted depending on the people and situation and people I am in. I also hold a emphasized belief in stoicism and discipline because of observing
						 certain habits that many people as well as myself has that can have negative effects. I am originally from Rio Claro but I just recently moved to D'Abadie to live with my father.
						 I lived with my mother and both grandparents before that. It is quite nice up here.</p><b/>
						 
						 <h2>Education</h2>
						 <ul>
						       <li><b><i>SSC, RCWS, COSTAATT</i></li>
				         </ul>
						 <p>I currently attend the College of Applied Arts and Sciences of Trinidad and Tobago. I am pursuing an associate's degree in Information Technology.
						    It is only my first semester though, before COSTAATT I attended Rio Claro West Secondary school where I stayed for 3 years to complete CSEC and Unit 1 of CAPE.
							Now if we go even before that, my time spent in St. Stephens College will also be observed before transferring over to RCWS. I am now at a stable point in my
							educational journey and I intend on studying in the United States Floria International University after my 2 years in COSTAATT.</p>
						 
						 <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
						 <ul>
						      <li><i>Cricket, Hunting, Video Games, Hacking, Spanish</i></li>
						</ul>
						  <p>In my freetime I do a variety of activities that all neeed to be balanced together. Cricket has been a common sport played on my mother's side of the family. Furthermore,
						     hunting was also made a priority by them as well since absolutely no one in the family can resist a well cooked manicou,iguana,agouti or armadillo. Then during the Covid 19
							 pandemic I spent the majority of my time raging while playing videos and willingly sleep depriving myself, all nighter after all nighter. I recently developed a liking to cybersecurity,
							 in particular the use of Kali Linux so I spend my time also learning new pentesting tools and methods. Finally, Spanish is on my list as well. My father is a fluent speaker in It and
						     sees it as very important for me to learn. I also feel the same way.</p>
